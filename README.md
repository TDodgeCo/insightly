This project creates a simple library that communicates with insightly api to create and get contacts lists. To test this library and show how it works was created a nodejs application with a simple web interface.

How to execute:

cd insightly

npm intall

node server.js

After that, open a browser window and type the address http://localhost:8080/.
First it is required to insert a valid API key of Insightly.
Once a valid API key is provided the user contact list is loaded and a form is displayed do create new contacts.
